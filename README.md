# Chennai Air Quality Anomaly Detection & Forecasting (2019â€“2023)

## About This Project

Accurate air quality monitoring is critical for public healthâ€”especially in rapidly urbanizing Indian cities like **Chennai**, where pollution patterns are influenced by festivals, monsoons, and lockdowns. This project introduces a **hybrid deep learning framework** for anomaly detection and AQI forecasting that combines:

-  **Feature-weighted Autoencoder** for unsupervised anomaly scoring  
-  **Reinforcement Learning Agent** for adaptive thresholding  
-  **Graph Attention Network (GAT)** for temporal and environmental feature fusion  
-  **LightGBM** for next-day AQI prediction  

Evaluated on 5 years of air quality data from **CPCB (2019â€“2023)**, this system demonstrates robust spike detection and forecasting across PM2.5, PM10, and NOâ‚‚â€”especially around events like **Diwali**, **New Year**, **Bhogi**, and **COVID-19 lockdowns**.

## âš™ Methodology

### 1. Preprocessing
- Merged CSVs from multiple monitoring stations
- Interpolation, forward/backward filling
- Spike filtering to reduce sensor noise

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Normalization using MinMaxScaler
- Event flags for Diwali, New Year, Bhogi, COVID lockdown
- Weather features: Wind Speed, Humidity
- Latent AE embeddings used as GAT input

### 3. Anomaly Detection Pipeline
- Autoencoder flags outliers based on reconstruction error
- RL agent dynamically adjusts thresholds using a custom reward function (season/festival-aware)
- GAT fuses pollutant, weather, and event features over time

### 4. AQI Forecasting
- LightGBM trained on GAT-fused features
- Predicts next-day pollutant concentration (PM2.5, PM10, NOâ‚‚)
